/**
 * suppose we are fetching data from an API and it turned out to be a bad API

 * and try to run it on the browser. It can lead to "cross-site script attack"
 * To avoid this, if any malicious data is passed, then JSX will check and then run it,
 * JSX will sanitize the data and then run automatically  
 * 
 * to render a React component:
 * <Title/>
 * instead: we can also write as <Title></Title>
 * <Title/> = <Title></Title>
 * 
 * google this : cross-site script attack
 * 
 * what is Heading(which is a functional component) at EOD?
 * 
 * if our code is fast and readable, then React is not making our code fast, JSX 
 * is helping out to make our code fast and readble with help of Bable and ofcourse, Parcel
