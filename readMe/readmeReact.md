/* "react" <- this is inside the node_module and being imported in to code
browser scripts cannot be imports or exports and as browser understand normal javascript script and javascript does not have any import/export
*/

/*
React.createElement("h1", {id:"heading"}, "Namaste ReactðŸš€");
//this is done using Core React
//this is not developer friendly
is equivalent to 

<h1 id = "heading1">Namaste ReactðŸš€ using JSX</h1>
//this is done using JSX

//React and JSX is different

How HTML is different from JSX?

if i want to give class name in HTML: 
<div class = "head"> hello </div>

if i want to give class name in JSX:
<h1 class = "head">Namaste ReactðŸš€ using JSX</h1>
